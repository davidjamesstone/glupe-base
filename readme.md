# (Checklist)
Once you clone this repository you'll need to make a few changes before you're ready to start:

- [ ] Add service name and description to the README above
- [ ] Update the `package.json` with the name, description and any git urls and authors etc.  
- [ ] Finally, remove the .git folder in the root directory. This will cut the cord to this boilerplate repo.

# Running the application

`$ node index.js`
